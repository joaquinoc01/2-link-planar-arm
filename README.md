# 2-link-planar-arm

This repository contains a simplified example implementation of a planar 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) robotic arm kinematics in C++. 

The project demonstrates:

- Forward kinematics: computing end-effector position from joint angles.
- Inverse kinematics: calculating possible joint angles for a desired end-effector position.
- Jacobian computation: relating joint velocities to end-effector velocity.
- Singularity detection based on the Jacobian determinant.

This example serves as a foundation for learning robotic manipulator kinematics and trajectory planning for educational purposes. The code is modular and designed for easy extension toward more advanced motion planning and control.
